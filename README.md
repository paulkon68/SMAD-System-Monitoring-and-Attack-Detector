1. Contains the buttons with the attack detection mechanisms. The user can select or de-select a utility.
2. Once the user's desired attack detection mechanisms are selected, to activate the attack detection function, the user should press the `Start Detector` button. Once this is done, the attack detection and the start detection buttons will be disabled and the attack detection process will begin.
3. If a potential attack is detected, the program will display information about it, such as the exact time the event occurred as well as other information about the compromised systems and the system from which the attack originated.
4. The `Export Data` button is used to save the information gathered in field three (3) to a file for further study of the findings.
